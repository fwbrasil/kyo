/** A log of transactional operations performed on TRefs within an STM transaction.
  *
  * RefLog maintains a mapping from transactional references to their pending read/write operations within a transaction. It tracks both
  * read entries (which record the version of data read) and write entries (which contain the new values to be committed).
  *
  * This type is used internally by the STM implementation and should not be accessed directly by application code.
  *
  * @note
  *   This is a private implementation detail of the STM system
